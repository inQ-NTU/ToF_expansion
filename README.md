# ToF_expansion
A minimal code to simulate interference pattern data acquisition and relative phase extraction in time-of-flight interferometry experiment for a pair of one-dimensional Bose gas. In particular, this code takes into account longitudinal expansion and coupling to common-phase degrees of freedom (see Ref. [1]). This code requires "Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox" and "Optimization Toolbox".
